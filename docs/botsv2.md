| Dataset          | Description | Size | Format | MD5 | 
| ---------------- | ----------- | ---- | ------ | --- |
| [BOTS V2 Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/botsdataset/botsv2/botsv2_data_set.tgz) |  Full BOTSv2 dataset. | 16.4GB | Pre-indexed Splunk | fd2673726c96e97a39fc03119d6686c6 |
| [BOTS V2 Dataset (Attack Only)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/botsdataset/botsv2/botsv2_data_set_attack_only.tgz) | BOTSv2 "attack-only" dataset. This dataset contains minimal non-attack-related (aka "clean") data. It's everything you need and nothing you don't! | 3.2GB | Pre-indexed Splunk | 6ea8f15cc4ccf6186db7a31415c09c58 | 

Note: Choose *either* the full dataset *or* the attack-only dataset.  You cannot install them both simultaneously. The BOTS V2 Dataset is a superset of the BOTS V2 Attack Only Dataset.

## Installation
1. Download the dataset file indicated above and check the MD5 hash to ensure integrity.
2. Install Splunk Enterprise and the apps/add-ons listed in the *Required Software* section below. It is important to match the specific version of each app and add-on.
3. Unzip/untar the downloaded file into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
4. Restart Splunk
5. The BOTS v2 data will be available by searching: 

```
index=botsv2 earliest=0
```
6. Note that because the data is distributed in a pre-indexed format, there are no volume-based licensing limits to be concerned with.
